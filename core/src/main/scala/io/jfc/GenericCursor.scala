/**
 * A zipper that represents a position in a JSON document and supports
 * navigation and modification.
 *
 * The `focus` represents the current position of the cursor; it may be updated
 * with `withFocus` or changed using navigation methods like `left` and `right`.
 *
 * jfc includes three kinds of cursors. [[Cursor]] is the simplest: it doesn't
 * keep track of its history. [[HCursor]] is a cursor that does keep track of
 * its history, but does not represent the possibility that an navigation or
 * modification operation has failed. [[ACursor]] is the richest cursor, since
 * it both tracks history through an underlying [[HCursor]] and can represent
 * failed operations.
 *
 * [[GenericCursor]] is an abstraction over these three types, and it has
 * several abstract type members that are required in order to represent the
 * different roles of the three cursor types. `Self` is simply the specific type
 * of the cursor, `Focus` is a type constructor that represents the context in
 * which the focus is available, `Result` is the type that is returned by all
 * navigation and modification operations, and `M` is a type class that includes
 * the operations that we need for `withFocusM`.
 *
 * @groupname ArrayNavigation Array navigation
 * @groupdesc ArrayNavigation Operations for moving around an array.
